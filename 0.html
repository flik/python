<h1>Install Python 3.6 in Mac or Windows</h1>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/">https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/</a>&nbsp;mac</p>

<p><a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a> download windows package</p>

<h1>Install Python 3.6 Linux (ubuntu)</h1>

<p>Ubuntu 16.04 comes with both Python 2.7 and Python 3.5 by default.</p>

<p>You can install Python 3.6 along with them via a <a href="https://launchpad.net/~jonathonf/+archive/ubuntu/python-3.6" target="_blank">third-party PPA</a> by doing following steps:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Open terminal via Ctrl+Alt+T or searching for &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo; from app launcher. When it opens, run command to add the PPA:</p>

<pre>
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:jonathonf/python-3.6</pre>

<p><em>Type in your password (no visual feedback due to security reason) when it asks and hit Enter.</em></p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://scontent.fisb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/52852250_422928035110334_1397257177554485248_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&_nc_ht=scontent.fisb1-1.fna&oh=a5eaa68944fa22fb91f8b32dbd408d9f&oe=5D1F3407" style="height:84px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> Then check updates and install Python 3.6 via commands:</p>

<pre>
sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3.6</pre>

<p>Now you have three Python versions, use <code>python</code> command for version 2.7, <code>python3</code> for version 3.5, and/or <code>python3.6</code> for version 3.6.1.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://scontent.fisb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/52657043_422928008443670_4956672892747120640_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&_nc_ht=scontent.fisb1-1.fna&oh=c0096e7aaf2431b79a585bb05e34b5b5&oe=5D265770" style="height:143px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> To make <code>python3</code> use the new installed python 3.6 instead of the default 3.5 release, run following 2 commands:</p>

<pre>
sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.5 1

sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.6 2</pre>

<p>Finally switch between the two python versions for <code>python3</code> via command:</p>

<pre>
sudo update-alternatives --config python3</pre>

<p><img alt="" src="https://scontent.fisb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/52532905_422928018443669_4687268556549652480_n.jpg?_nc_cat=110&_nc_ht=scontent.fisb1-1.fna&oh=5b1588f0155873e5d720613d4f2a654c&oe=5CDA8A48" style="height:179px; width:600px" /></p>

<p>After selecting version 3.6:</p>

<pre>
python3 -V</pre>

<p><img alt="" src="https://scontent.fisb1-1.fna.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/52585260_422928125110325_3430900063084216320_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&_nc_ht=scontent.fisb1-1.fna&oh=6f2f1ead20e7c16a3fde80ab42518274&oe=5CE879F8" style="height:75px; width:600px" /></p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong> due to this <a href="https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/python3.6/+bug/1631367" target="_blank">bug</a>, gnome-terminal won&rsquo;t launch after step 3, a workaround is running following commands to recreate the symlink:</p>

<pre>
sudo rm /usr/bin/python3

sudo ln -s python3.5 /usr/bin/python3</pre>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Python PIP</h1>

<p>PIP is a package manager same like composer in php for include libraries/Model.</p>

<p>install the package named &quot;camelcase&quot;: $ pip install camelcase</p>

<p>Uninstall the package named &quot;camelcase&quot;: $ pip uninstall camelcase</p>

<p>List installed packages: $ pip list</p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h1>Python Exception Handling</h1>

<p>In Python, an exception is an error that may incur while executing a program. When an error occurs, or exception as we call it, Python will normally stop and generate an error message.</p>

<p>The <code>try</code> - block lets you test a block of code for errors.</p>

<p> 
		<code> else  </code>- The else clause is used to execute a code, when there is no exception raised. It is appropriate to use the else clause than adding code to try clause. The else clause avoids unintentional catching of code.
		 </p>
<p>The <code>except</code> - block lets you handle the error.</p>
<p> 
		<code>print(“incompatible operand types to perform sum”)
			</code> </p>
<p> <code>raise </code> – The raise clause allows the programmer to force an error to occur
 	</p>
<p>The <code>finally</code> - block lets you execute code, regardless of the result of the try- and except blocks.</p>
 
<h4> Common exceptions in Python </h4>
<ul>

	<li>
		    IOError: This error happens if the file cannot be opened.
   </li>

   <li> ImportError: This error happens when python cannot find the module
   </li>

   <li>
		ValueError: This error occurs when a built-in operation or function receives an argument that has the correct type but a wrong value
		
   </li>

   <li>
		KeyboardInterrupt: This error occurs if you stop the CPython program by using the interrupt key (normally Control-C or Delete). The Python interpreter immediately throws up KeyboardInterrupt error.
		
   </li>

   <li>
		EOFError: The end of file statement error occurs when one of the built-in functions (input() or raw_input()) hits an end-of-file condition (EOF) without reading any data. This means that there was open parenthesis on a line which is not matching closing parenthesis. Hence the EOF error.
		
   </li>
</ul>
<h4>Tools that identify the bugs and perform static analysis.</h4>
<p>
		<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/pychecker/"> Pychecker </a> is a static analysis tool. This tool detects bugs from Python source code. It also cautions about style and complexity of the bug.
<br><br>
<a href="https://www.pylint.org/#install"> Pylint </a> tool verifies whether the module meets the coding standard.
		
</p>

<h4>What is a thread? What is a multithread?</h4>
<p>
		Threading feature is provided by an operating system. Threading is lighter than processes and shares the same memory space.

		A thread has a beginning, an execution sequence, and a conclusion.

<br> Multi-threading share the same data space within the same process. They can share data, communicate effectively, then when they were a separate process.

</p>

<h2>Python Quickstart</h2>
<p> Python are compiled in bytecode and then executed by the host </p>
<p>Type in terminal: $ python 1.py</p>

<h4> .py and .pyc files</h4>
<p>
		In Python, both .py and .pyc files hold the bytecode. .py files are Python source files. 
		<br><br>
		.pyc are the compiled bytecode files, generated by Python compiler.
</p>
<h4>How can a python script be executed on Unix?</h4>
<p>The steps to execute a python script on Unix are:
<br>
		<br>Script file’s mode must be executable
		<br>The first line must begin with # ( #!/usr/local/bin/python)</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/1.py">code sample:</a></p>

<h2>Python Syntax</h2>

<p>Python uses indentation to indicate a block of code.</p>

<p>Comments start with a # for single line &quot;&quot;&quot; this is for multiple like comments</p>

<h4>What is namespace in Python? What are local and global namespaces?</h4>
<p>
		The namespace is an address location, where variable name and object are mapped. When you search a variable, the address location also gets searched, to get a corresponding object.
<br>
		<br>Local namespaces are created within a function when that function is called.
		<br>
		<br>When a program starts, then global namespaces are created.
</p>
<h4>What is PEP8?</h4>
<p> PEP 8 is a coding convention which helps to make Python code more readable. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/pep8-tutorial-python-code" >PEP8 guide tutorial </a></p>

<h2>Creating Variables</h2>

<p>A variable can have a short name (like x and y) or a more descriptive name (age, carname, total_volume). Rules for Python variables:</p>

<ul>
	<li>A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character</li>
	<li>A variable name cannot start with a number</li>
	<li>A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )</li>
	<li>Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)</li>
</ul>

<p>Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type and can even change type after they have been set.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/4.py">code sample:</a></p>

<h2>Specify a Variable Type</h2>

<p>int() - constructs an integer number</p>

<p>float() - constructs a float number</p>

<p>str() - constructs a string</p>

<h4>Python builds mutable and immutable built-in-types</h4>>
<p><strong>Mutable:</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>List</li>
	<li>Sets</li>
	<li>Dictionary</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Immutable built-in types</strong></p>

<ul>
	<li>Strings</li>
	<li>Tuples</li>
	<li>Numbers</li>
</ul>


<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/3.py">code sample:</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Numbers</h2>

<p>There are three numeric types in Python:</p>

<ul>
	<li>int</li>
	<li>float</li>
	<li>complex</li>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Strings</h2>

<p> To modify the strings, Python’s “re” module provides 3 methods. They are: </p>
<ul>

	<li> split() – uses a regex pattern to “split” a given string into a list. </li>
	<li> sub() – locates all substrings where the regex pattern matches and then different string is replaced. </li>
	<li> subn() – This method is similar to a sub() and it returns the new string along with the no. of replacements. </li>
</ul>

<h4> What is docstring?</h4>

<p>A python documentation string is called docstring. Docstring documents python functions, modules, and classes.
	</p>
<h4>What is pickling and unpickling?</h4>
<p>
		They python pickle module is a process where any object is converted into a byte stream. Later dumps into a file using dump function. This process is termed as pickling.
<br><br>
		Unpickling is when the byte stream is converted back into objects, The process of retrieving the original python objects from stored string representation is called unpickling.
<br><br>
		The other names for pickling and unpickling are serialization, marshalling, or flattening. The pickling process is done to save the objects in a disc.
</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/5.py">code sample</a></p>

<h2>Python Operators</h2>

<p>Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values.</p>

<p>Python divides the operators in the following groups:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Arithmetic operators</li>
	<li>Assignment operators</li>
	<li>Comparison operators</li>
	<li>Logical operators</li>
	<li>Identity operators</li>
	<li>Membership operators</li>
	<li>Bitwise operators</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use of a //operator in Python?</h4>
<p>
		A // operator is a floor division operator, used for dividing two operands. The quotient shows only digits before the decimal points.

		For example: <code>10//5=2 and 10.0//5.0=2.0</code>
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/2.py">code sample</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Collections (Arrays)</h2>

<p>There are four collection data types in the Python programming language:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>List</strong> is a collection which is ordered and changeable. Allows duplicate members.</li>
	<li><strong>Tuple</strong> A sequence of immutable Python objects is known as tuples. Tuples are just like lists except that tuples cannot be changed. Allows duplicate members.</li>
	<li><strong>Set</strong> is a collection which is unordered and unindexed. No duplicate members.</li>
	<li><strong>Dictionary</strong> is a collection which is unordered, changeable and indexed. No duplicate members.</li>
</ul>
<h4>What are dict or list comprehensions?</h4>

<p>Dict and list comprehensions are syntax constructions to simplify the creation of dictionary.
	</p>

<b>Tip: </b> 
dictionary.values() # use to get all the values from dictionary
<br>dictionary.keys() # use to get all the keys from dictionary
<h4>What is slicing?</h4>
<p>Slicing is a selection of a range of items from sequence types like list, tuple, strings etc.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/list.py">code sample:</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Conditions and If statements</h2>

<p>Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:</p>

<ul>
	<li>Equals: a == b</li>
	<li>Not Equals: a != b</li>
	<li>Less than: a &lt; b</li>
	<li>Less than or equal to: a &lt;= b</li>
	<li>Greater than: a &gt; b</li>
	<li>Greater than or equal to: a &gt;= b</li>
</ul>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/2.py">code sample:</a></p>

<h2>Python Loops</h2>

<p>Python has two primitive loop commands:</p>

<ul>
	<li>while loops</li>
	<li>for loops</li>
</ul>

<h4> Difference between X-Range and Range. </h4>

<p>Xrange returns the xrange object. A range returns the list, and uses the same memory and no matter what the range size is.
	</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/loops.py">code sample:</a></p>

<h2>Python Function</h2>

<p>A function is a block of code which only runs when it is called.</p>

<p>You can pass data, known as parameters, into a function.</p>

<p>A function can return data as a result.</p>

<p>In Python a function is defined using the def keyword:</p>

<p>A lambda function is a small anonymous function.</p>


<h4>What is pass in python?</h4>
<p> 
		An operation in Python statement is a “pass”. Just a blank is left.
example: <pre>
	<code>
			class MyClass(object):
			def meth_a(self):
				pass
		
			def meth_b(self):
				print "I'm meth_b"
	</code>
</pre>
If you were to leave out the pass, the code wouldn't run.
	</p>


<h4>few Python modules for Statistical, Numerical and scientific calculations. </h4>
<ul>
	<li>
numPy – provides an array/matrix type computation. It is useful for doing computations on arrays.
</li>
<li>
scipy – provides methods for doing numeric integrals, solving differential equations
</li>
<li>
etc pylab – is a module for generating and saving plots
</li>
<li>
matplotlib – used for managing data and generating plots.
</li>
</ul>

<h4>Check the file existence and their types</h4>
<p>
		 os.path.exists() – This method is used to check the existence of a file. Python returns True if the file exists, otherwise false
		<br>
		<br><br>os.path.isfile() – This method is used to check if the given path references a file or not. Python returns True if the path references to a file, else it returns false.
		
		<br><br>os.path.isdir() – This method is used to check whether the given path references a directory or not. It returns True if the path references to a directory, else it returns false.
		
		<br><br>os.path.getsize() – returns the size of the given file
		
		<br><br>os.path.getmtime() – returns the time of the given path when last accessed. The value returned is a number.

		<br><br> os.remove (filename) or os.unlink(filename) -  to delete a file. 
</p>
<h4>Generate random numbers in python?</h4>
<pre><code>
		import random

		random.random()
	</code></pre>
	<p>	
			This command will return random floating point number in the range (0,1)
	</p>
<h4>Few methods that are helpful in the implementation of Functionally Oriented Programming </h4>
<p>
		Some methods supported by Python (called iterators in Python3), such as filter (), map(), and reduce(), are very useful when you need to repeat over the items in a list, create a dictionary, or extract a subset of a list.
		<br><br>
		Filter () – helps you to extract a subset of values based on conditional logic.
		<br><br>
		map() – it is a built-in function that applies the function to each item in an iterable.
		<br><br>
		reduce() – iterates a pair-wise reduction on a sequence for single value computation.
</p>
<h4>Overriding method</h4>
<p> This feature is very important in Object-oriented programming like Python as it makes inheritance to get exploited to the fullest potential. Overriding may copy a class without duplicating the code. This feature enhances or customizes a part of the code. </p>

<h4>
		Two built-in functions which come on the keyboard by default to read a line of text from standard input:
</h4>
<p>
		The built-in functions to read a line of text from standard input, which comes from the keyboard by default are:

		<br>
		Raw_input and input
</p>

<h4>What are decorators?</h4>
<p>
		A decorator is a function that takes a function and returns a function or takes a class and returns a class.
		<br>Here are:  @classmethod, @staticmethod, @property
</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/functions.py">code sample:</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Classes/Objects</h2>

<p>Python is an object oriented programming language.

	 OOP is the programming is based on classes and instances of those classes called objects. The features of OOP are:

		Encapsulation, Data Abstraction, Inheritance, Polymorphism.
</p>

<p>Almost everything in Python is an object, with its properties and methods.</p>

<p>A class is a blueprint/ template of code /collection of objects that has the same set of attributes and behavior. You can create a class using the keyword class followed by class name beginning with an uppercase letter.</p>
<h4>construction and initialization of custom Objects</h4>
<p> Python uses three methods in the construction and initialization of custom Objects. They are init, new, and del.

			</p>
<ul>
	<li>
			new – this method can be considered as a “constructor”.
		</li>
	<li>
			init — It is an “initializer”/ “constructor” method. It is invoked whenever any arguments are passed at the time of creating an object.	
	</li>
	<li>
				
			del- this method is a “destructor” of the class. Whenever an object is deleted,
	</li>
	<li>
			invocation of del__ takes place and it defines behavior during the garbage collection.

	</li>
</ul>
<h4>Inheritance in Python</h4>
<p>
		The different types of inheritance supported by the Python are:

		Single, multi-level, hierarchical and multiple inheritances.
	
		</p>
<ul>
	 

	<li>
			Single Inheritance –This is a situation where a derived class acquires the members of a single superclass.
		
	</li>
<li>Multi-level inheritance – a derived class d1 in inherited from base class base1, and d2 are inherited from base2.
	</li>

	<li>
			Hierarchical inheritance – You can inherit any number of child classes from one base class.
	</li>
<li>
		Multiple inheritances – a derived class is inherited from more than one base class.

</li>

</ul>

<h4> Determine the type of instance and inheritance</h4>
<p>

		There are two built-in functions that work with inheritance in Python.
<br>
		<br>1.   isinstance() – this method checks the type of instance.
		<br>
		<br>2.  issubclass() – this method checks class inheritance
		<br><br>
		Issubclass(unicode, str) – returns False because “unicode” is not a subclass of “str”.
</p>

<h2>Python Iterators</h2>

<p>Iterators are used to iterate ( repeat ) a group of elements, containers etc. An iterator is an object that contains a countable number of values.</p>

<p>An iterator is an object that can be iterated upon, meaning that you can traverse through all the values.</p>

<p>Technically, in Python, an iterator is an object which implements the iterator protocol, which consist of the methods <code>__iter__()</code> and <code>__next__()</code>.</p>

<h4>What are generators?</h4>

<p>The method of implementing iterators is known as generators.
	</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/iterator.py">code sample:</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Python Datestimes</h2>

<p>A date in Python is not a data type of its own, but we can import a module named <code>datetime</code> to work with dates as date objects.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/flik/python/blob/master/datetime.py">code sample:</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Files in Python</h2>
<p>

 The shortest way to open a text file is by using “with” command.
<br>
This is done as shown:
</br>
With open ("file-name", "r") as fp:
<br>
fileData = fp.read()
<br>
#to print the contents of the file print (fileData)

</p>

<h4> Display the contents of the text file in reverse order in Python?
 </h4>
<p>
 1. Convert the given file into a list.

<br />2. Reverse the list by using reverse ()

</p>
<p> To delete a file, you must import the OS module, and run its os.remove() function: </p>
 <p>

<h4>The key function for working with files in Python is the open() function.
</h4>
<p>The open() function takes two parameters; filename, and mode.

There are four different methods (modes) for opening a file:
</p>
<br> "r" - Read - Default value. Opens a file for reading, error if the file does not exist

<br> "a" - Append - Opens a file for appending, creates the file if it does not exist

<br> "w" - Write - Opens a file for writing, creates the file if it does not exist

<br> "x" - Create - Creates the specified file, returns an error if the file exists

<h4> In addition you can specify if the file should be handled as binary or text mode
</h4>
 "t" - Text - Default value. Text mode

<br> "b" - Binary - Binary mode (e.g. images)


 </p>

<h2>What is a Module </h2>

<p>Consider a module to be the same as a code library.</p>

<p>A file containing a set of functions, classes and dictionaries&nbsp;you want to include in your application.</p>
<h3>Note: What is a module and package in Python?</h3>
<p>
		A module is a way to structure program. Each Python program file is a module, which imports other modules like objects and attributes.  A module is a Python file with .py extension. A package is a namespace which can have modules or subfolders. A package is a simple directory.

<h4> ODBC and Python</h4>
<p>
		ODBC (“Open Database Connectivity) API standard allows the connections with any database that supports the interface, such as PostgreSQL database or Microsoft Access in a transparent manner. There are 3 ODBC modules for Python:
<br>
		<br>1. PythonWin ODBC module – limited development
		
		<br> 2. mxODBC – a commercial product
		
		<br> 3. pyodbc– it is an open source Python package.
</p>

<h4>Randomize the items of a list </h4>
<p>
		Python has a built-in module called . This module exports a public method <shuffle()> which can randomize any input sequence.
<br>
<pre><code>
	import randomlist = [2, 18, 8, 4]
	print "Prior Shuffling – 0", listrandom.shuffle(list)
	print "After Shuffling – 1", listrandom.shuffle(list)
	print "After Shuffling – 2", list
	</code>
</pre>

<h1>Python RegEx</h1>

<p>A RegEx, or Regular Expression, is a sequence of characters that forms a search pattern.</p>

<p>Python has a built-in package called <code>re</code>, which can be used to work with Regular Expressions.</p>
<br>
<p>
	The four methods to perform pattern matching in “re”: </p>
<ul>
<li>	Match() – matches the regular expression pattern only to the beginning of the String and not to the beginning of each line. </li>
	
<li> Search() – scans the string and look for a location where the regular expression pattern matches.</li>	
	
<li>Findall() – finds all the occurrences of the match and return them as a list. </li>
	
<li>Finditer() – finds all the occurrences of the match and return them as an iterator.</li>	
</ul>

<h2>JSON in Python</h2>
<p>

JSON – stands for JavaScript Object Notation. It is a common data format for storing data in NoSQL databases.  JSON is built on 2 structures:
</p>
<br> 1.  A collection of <name, value> pairs.

<br>2.  An ordered list of values.
<p>
As Python supports JSON parsers, JSON-based data is actually represented as a dictionary in Python. You can convert JSON data into python using load() of JSON module.
</p>
<p>Python has a built-in package called <code>json</code>, which can be use to work with JSON data.</p>
